25. Context managers
Context managers allow you to allocate and release resources precisely when you want to.
The most widely used example of context managers is the with statement.
Suppose you have two related operations which you'd like to execute as a pair, with a block of code in between.
Context managers allow you to do specifically that. For example:

with open('some_file', 'w') as opened_file:
    opened_file.write('Hola!')
